These include real-time malware scanning and removal, a web application firewall (WAF), and automated backups. They also offer free SSL certificates to encrypt data transmitted between your website and visitors.

### Pricing:
Scala Hosting's managed VPS plans start at affordable prices, offering excellent value for the features and resources included. They also offer shared hosting plans, but for a serious landlord blog, the VPS options are recommended for better performance and control.
