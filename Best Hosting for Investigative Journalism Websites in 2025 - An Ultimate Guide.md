Scala Hosting stands out as a robust and reliable option, particularly for investigative journalism websites. Their focus on security, performance, and customer support makes them an excellent choice for protecting sensitive information and ensuring website uptime.

### Managed VPS Hosting Excellence:
Scala Hosting truly shines with its managed VPS hosting. This provides a dedicated virtual server environment with resources allocated solely to your website. Managed means Scala Hosting handles all the technical aspects of server administration, including security updates, patching, and monitoring, allowing you to focus on your reporting. Scala also offers unmanaged VPS plans if you prefer to handle the server administration yourself, but for investigative journalism, managed is generally preferred for its added security expertise.

### Enhanced Security Measures:
Security is paramount for investigative journalists. Scala Hosting offers a suite of security features including real-time malware scanning, automated backups, and a custom-built security shield to prevent intrusions. Their SShield Security is an AI-powered system that blocks 99.998% of web attacks, providing a critical layer of protection against malicious actors. They also offer free SSL certificates to encrypt data transmitted between your website and its visitors.

### SPanel Control Panel Advantage:
Unlike many providers that rely on cPanel, Scala Hosting offers its own custom-built SPanel control panel. SPanel is designed to be more user-friendly, resource-efficient, and secure than cPanel. It allows you to easily manage your website, email accounts, databases, and security settings from a single interface. SPanel also includes features like one-click WordPress installation and a built-in website builder.

### Free Website Migration:
Migrating an existing investigative journalism website to a new host can be daunting. Scala Hosting offers free website migration services to seamlessly transfer your website, files, and databases to their servers without any downtime. Their experienced team handles the entire migration process, ensuring a smooth transition.

### Pricing:
Scala Hosting offers a range of pricing plans to suit different needs and budgets. Their shared hosting plans start at around $3.95 per month, while their managed VPS plans start at around $14.95 per month. The VPS plans are highly recommended for investigative journalism websites due to the increased security and performance they offer.
