The one-click WordPress installation is a significant advantage for creating a blog or tutorial site.

### Hosting Features:
Bluehost provides various hosting options, including shared hosting, VPS hosting, and dedicated hosting. For leather burnishing tutorials, the shared hosting plans are generally sufficient to start.

### Performance and Uptime:
Bluehost guarantees a reasonable uptime, typically around 99.9%, which is essential to ensure that your tutorials are always accessible to your audience. Their servers are optimized for WordPress, meaning that you can expect good performance when using WordPress as your content management system (CMS). However, it is important to note that some users have reported occasional slow loading times during peak hours.

### Customer Support:
Bluehost offers 24/7 customer support through phone, email, and live chat. Their support team is generally responsive and helpful, although the quality of support can vary depending on the representative you speak with. They also have an extensive knowledge base and a library of tutorials that can help you troubleshoot common issues.

### Pricing:
Bluehost's shared hosting plans start at around $2.95 per month for the basic plan. However, this price is only available if you sign up for a long-term contract (typically 36 months). Renewal prices are significantly higher. More advanced plans offer additional features, such as unlimited websites and more storage space, but come at a higher cost.
